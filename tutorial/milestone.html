  	 <h2 align="middle"> Overview</h2>
  		<p> In the past two weeks, we refocused our project slightly. Orginally we had planned to created a maze game from the first person point of view. However, we thought it would be fun to do something more specific to Berkeley. Ollie  stumbled upon a reddit thread containing a Dwinelle Hall Nagivator. This navigator was created by Daniel Kessler, another UC Berkeley student. We thought that it was a wonderful idea considering how perilous navigating through Dwinelle Hall can be. In that moment, we realized that Dwinelle Hall would be the most perfect maze for our game and thus we began a refocused project, the Dwinelle Hall First Person Navigator. Daniel Kessler implement a simple wire frame for his visualization so we are planning to use his geometry and tranfrom this visualiation into a first person point of view game. </p>

  	<h2 align="middle"> Accomplishments</h2>
        <p> We have been able to render a basic hallway with realistic lighting effects. This basic hallway is going to be the basis of our game. We used Phong shading for a more realistic depiction of the hallway. Additionally we implement camera rotations of that the user can see the hallway from varied points of view. We also added an frames per second counter to determine how many frames per second are being rendered. </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Timeline progress </h2>
        <p> We were able to accomplish everything we set out to do in week one. We started building our pipeline and were able to render basic geometry. We set up our website and got our code to run in the browser. We have partially implemented our goals for week two. We have created a realistic looking hallway but have not rendered the whole maze. To create the full maze we are going to use the dimensions of each hallway in Dwinelle Hall. This data was collected by Daniel Kessler. </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Updated Timeline </h2>
        <p> Since the goal of our project changed slightly our timeline needs to be adjusted. In week three we now plan to  use Kessler’s geometry for Dwinelle Hall to render realistically sized hallways, implement users controls and work on how the camera moves through the scene, and accurately represent each hallway with the appropriate textures. In week four we plan to possibly implement more advanced light techniques and prepare for our presentation</p>

        Week 3
        <ul> 
        	<li> Integrate Kessler’s geometry for Dwinelle Hall</li> 
        	<li> Implement users controls</li> 
        	<li> Hallway textures </li>
        </ul>

        Week 4
        <ul> <li> Advanced lighting</li> 
        	<li> Presenation preparation</li>
        </ul>
